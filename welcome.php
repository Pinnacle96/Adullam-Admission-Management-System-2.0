            I am excited to welcome you to <strong>RCN Theological Seminary - Adullam.</strong> Adullam was
            established in 2015 as a response to the need to equip Christian leaders who will bring accurate
            witness unto Christ in all spheres of life. Adullam is a vibrant community of students,
            faculties, scholars, counsellors and friends living and learning together in the belief that
            moral and religious values in education are a life-changing experience to which everyone is
            called.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Our Seminary is a community bound by a strong commitment to collaboration, respect, diversity,
            inclusion and learning from one another. This is done within the limits of our absolute devotion
            to Christ and faithfulness to the scriptures. We are a Bible-believing community with a firm
            commitment to biblical orthodoxy, spiritual formation, and the acknowledgement of the
            supernatural operations of the Spirit of God.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            We are known for our commitment to excellence in theological scholarship and spiritual
            formation, which has produced alumni who are making impact both in the church and the society.
            We welcome you to partner with us in shaping the future of the next generation and bringing
            transformation of our society to the glory of God.

          We are known for our commitment to excellence in theological scholarship and spiritual formation,
          which has produced alumni who are making impact both in the church and the society. We welcome you
          to partner with us in shaping the future of the next generation and bringing transformation of our
          society to the glory of God.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also encourage personal and social responsibility by creating opportunities for students to share
          their learning with the community and to make meaningful contributions to the places where they
          live. The result, we believe, are graduates who are prepared to engage the complexities of life in a
          changing world with curiosity, empathy, joy, and resilience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please know that in our Seminary, we have invested in your success and look forward to the many ways
          in which we will enhance your academic learning. We offer a great support system to assist you; so
          please do not hesitate to ask for help and advice when you become part of our community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beside your academic endeavour, it is our belief that you will make yourself available for one
          entrepreneurship skill acquisition or another during your four years of studies with us. There are
          available things we expect you to use your hands with alongside your studies that will prepare you
          for the limited opportunities in our Nigerian society today. Become a full, active, and engaged
          member of the Adullam community today and you will have a lifetime experience you will never forget.
